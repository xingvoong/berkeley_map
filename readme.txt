Class project, source: https://cs61bl.org/su18/projects/bearmaps/

- I wrote the back endâ€”the web server that powers the API that the front end makes requests to.

Setup:

- The project uses Apache Maven as its build system.
- To build: run MapServer.java and open localhost:4567 on a web browser.
