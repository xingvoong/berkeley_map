- This project is a version of Google Maps for the town of Berkeley, 

- It is a web mapping application inspired by Alan Yao's time on the Google Maps team and the OpenStreetMap project, from which the tile images and map feature data was downloaded

- This code uses Java Spark as the server framework

- The Params files, RasterRequestParams, RasterResultParams, RouterRequestParams, RouteResultParams were given from the authors.

- I wrote the back endâ€”the web server that powers the API that the front end makes requests to.

Setup:

- The project uses Apache Maven as its build system.
- To build: run MapServer.java and open localhost:4567 on a web browser.
